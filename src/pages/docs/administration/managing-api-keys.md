> **[Postman API key management is available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

The [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/) enables you to integrate Postman into your development toolchain, but requires API keys to do so. Team Admins can manage the Postman API keys your team creates at scale, ensuring you maintain compliance and security across your organization. Teams can control the creation of API keys, their expiration dates, and revoke keys when needed.

You must be a [Team Admin or Super Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to use the Postman API key management dashboard.

> SCIM API keys can be managed in [Team Settings](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/auth).

## Managing Postman API keys

To open the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys), select **Team > Manage Postman Keys** in the Postman header.

The dashboard lists all of the Postman API keys created by your team. To filter the list by enabled, disabled, or revoked keys, select or clear the checkboxes next to **View**.

You can review when a key was generated, its expiration date, who created it and their level of access within the team, and when it was last used. You can also search by key value to locate a specific key, filter by user by selecting them in the **Created by** menu, and sort by newest, oldest, and recently used.

Tags next to the API key's name specify when it is disabled or revoked. You can hover over a revoked tag to see if a Team Admin revoked it or if it was due to inactivity past its expiration date. Revoked API keys also display their revocation date under its creation date.

### Exposed API keys

If the [Postman Secret Scanner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/token-scanner/) detects exposed Postman API keys in public Postman workspaces or [GitHub](/docs/administration/token-scanner/#protecting-postman-api-keys-in-github) and [GitLab](/docs/administration/token-scanner/#protecting-postman-api-keys-in-gitlab) repositories, the dashboard displays them in the **Exposed API keys** section. This section provides details about the exposed key, such the date of its exposure detection, the last time it was used, and the location of the exposed API key.

You can manage how Postman automatically handles exposed API keys in the [API key settings](#revoking) section of the Postman API key management dashboard.

### Revoking API keys

You can revoke an API key in the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys) by hovering over it and selecting **Revoke**. To revoke multiple API keys at once, select the checkboxes next to each key, then select **Revoke** above the list.

Postman notifies users by email when their API keys are revoked. For exposed keys, revoking also resolves the Secret Scanner finding in the [Secret Scanner dashboard](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/token-scanner/#secret-scanner-dashboard).

### API key settings

You can manage your team's API key settings and permissions by selecting **API Key Settings** in the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys).

#### Generation and expiry

By default, anyone in your team can generate Postman API keys. To turn this setting off, select the toggle next to **Allow anyone in your team to generate API keys**.

You can also set the expiration settings for all keys generated by your team under **Set expiry for API keys**. This setting overrides any expiration choices that users previously set and will be effective moving forward for all of your team's Postman API keys.

#### Revoking

Enable the **Auto revoke exposed Postman API keys** setting to let Postman automatically revoke any publicly exposed API keys. When the Postman Secret Scanner detects any exposed keys in public GitHub or GitLab repositories or Postman workspaces, it revokes the key and notify the key's owner by email.

To revoke all of your team's generated Postman API keys, select **Revoke All**. Postman notifies users by email when their API keys are revoked.
