### Set up your Enterprise features

If you're setting up a [Postman Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you can learn more about all of the additional features available to you in [Postman Enterprise plans](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-postman-enterprise/). Enterprise features include advanced identity management, reports, a private API Network, API governance and security controls, and features that enhance collaboration and administrative customization. 

## Manage your Postman team

You can add and remove team members, Partners, and Guests in your [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members).

## Secure your Postman team

You can secure your Postman team's users by setting up [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/), [SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), and [domain verification and capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/). You can also [manage your team's API keys](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-api-keys/), utilize the [Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/) to detect exposed secrets, and access your team's [audit logs](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/audit-logs/) as needed.
