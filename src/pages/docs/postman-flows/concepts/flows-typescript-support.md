> TypeScript support for Postman Flows is in beta.

The **Evaluate** block in Postman Flows now supports TypeScript in addition to [Flows Query Langauge (FQL)](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/).

To use TypeScript in an **Evaluate** block, select **TypeScript** from the dropdown list and enter your code in the block.
