[Documentation](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-documentation/) is an important part of any collection or API. Good documentation helps the people who use your collection to understand what it does and how each request works. And comprehensive API documentation lets your consumers know what endpoints are available and how to interact with them.

Postman automatically creates documentation for your collections and APIs. To give your consumers more help and context, use Postman's built-in editing tools to add descriptions, images, videos, and more to your documentation.

## Contents

## Document a collection

Postman automatically creates collection documentation, including requests and authorization details. To better help users, you can add a detailed description to your collection and to folders and requests in the collection.

## Add documentation to an API

Postman automatically generates documentation based on your API definition (for OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 APIs). To created more detailed API docs, add more or more collections to your API. You can add an existing collection, or generate a collection based on your API definition.

## Choose a documentation editor

You can use the Postman editor to view how your content will look as you write it. Or use standard Markdown syntax to write content and leave the formatting to Postman. With either editor, you can format text, add links, and insert images and videos in your documentation.
