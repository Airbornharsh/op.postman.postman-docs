When you configure a [performance test](/docs/collections/performance-testing/testing-api-performance/), you specify a number of virtual users. During the test, each virtual user runs the selected requests in the specified order in a repeating loop.

By default, each virtual user runs the same requests using the same values. You can customize the behavior of virtual users by importing a CSV or JSON file. Each virtual user can send requests using different values from the imported data file. This enables you to better simulate real-world traffic when testing the performance of your API.

## Data file format

Format the CSV file so that the first row has the variable names you want to use inside the requests. After that, every row will be used as a data row. The line endings of the CSV file must be in Unix format. Each row must have the same number of columns.

For CSV files, note the following:

* If the numbers in your data file are longer than 15 digits, you'll need to format them as text in your spreadsheet program, so they're not truncated when exporting to CSV format.

* If your CSV file has numbers longer than 15 digits, numbers with preceding zeroes (for example, `000000345`), or phone numbers (for example, `+12125556709`), you'll need to specify the column type in **Preview**. Learn how in the next section.

Format JSON files as an array of key-value pairs. Each key is the name of a variable, and the value is the data to use within the request.

## Run a performance test with a data file

Select a Data file with custom values to use for each virtual user.
