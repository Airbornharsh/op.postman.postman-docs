SoapUI is an API testing tool that supports SOAP and REST services. Postman can import SoapUI project files and automatically convert them into collections, folders, and requests.

## Import a SoapUI project

To import a SoapUI project into Postman, do the following:

1. Select **Import**, then select **Migrate to Postman > SoapUI**.
1. Select **files** or **folder**, then select the files or folder you want to import.
1. Select **Open**.
1. Select **Start Migration**. A window appears showing the migrationâ€™s progress. When the migration is complete, select **Dismiss**. The SoapUI project appears in your workspace as a collection.

  > You can also drag files and folders into the import window.
