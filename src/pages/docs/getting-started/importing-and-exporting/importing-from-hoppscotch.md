Hoppscotch is an open-source API development ecosystem used for testing APIs. Postman can import collection and environment files exported from Hoppscotch.

## Import from Hoppscotch

To import Hoppscotch files into Postman, do the following:

1. In Postman, select **Import > Migrate to Postman > Other API Clients**.
1. Select **files** or **folder**, then select the files or folder you want to import.
1. Select **Open**. Postman checks if the selected files are valid Hoppscotch files.
1. If the files are valid, you can select **Start Migration**. A window appears showing the migrationâ€™s progress. When the migration is complete, select **Dismiss**.

  > You can also drag files and folders into the import window.
