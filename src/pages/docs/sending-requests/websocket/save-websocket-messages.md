## Save WebSocket messages

You can save composed messages, then resend them later.

To save a message, do the following:

1. Compose a message (see [Send WebSocket messages](/docs/sending-requests/websocket/send-websocket-messages/)).
1. Select **Save Message**.
1. The message title ("New Message" by default) is editable. Enter a new title and press Return.

To load a saved message, do the following:

1. Open the **Saved Messages** pane next to the editor pane.
1. Select a saved message. It will be loaded into the editor pane.
1. You can then send the message, or edit it and select **Save Message** to save the changes. Select **Discard Changes** to remove them.

You can also create a new message from the **Saved Messages** pane by selecting <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px"> **Compose Message**.

To rename, duplicate, or delete a saved message, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> and then select **Rename**, **Duplicate**, or **Delete**.
