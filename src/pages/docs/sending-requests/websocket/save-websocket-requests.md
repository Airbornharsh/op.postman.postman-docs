You can save your WebSocket requests into a collection. This enables you to reuse requests, share them with other team members, and add documentation to the collection of requests.

To save a new request, do the following:

1. Select **Save** in the request tab.
1. Under **Save to**, select a collection, or select **New collection**. (Note that there are limitations to WebSocket requests in collections. Keep reading for more information.)
1. If youâ€™re creating a new collection, enter a name and select **Create**.
1. Select **Save**.

Postman will display your collection and saved request in **Collections** in the sidebar.

Because WebSocket requests have different features than HTTP requests, when they're added to a collection, it causes the collection to be in a beta state with certain limitations.

When in this state, a collection can contain WebSocket or gRPC requests. It can't contain HTTP requests. Some features related to collections aren't supported, such as collaboration, version control, or scripting.
